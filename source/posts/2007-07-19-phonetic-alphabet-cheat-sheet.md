Below is a quick cheat sheet I made up to help out when I was on the phone with people. Inevitably you have to either read off an account number or spell out some weird URL and run into a conversation like this:

**Tech Support**: Please read off your account number

**Me**: k, 005V345

**Tech**: Thank you, I have that as 005B345

**Me**: No, that’s V as in Victor not B as in Bravo

Now I keep this next to the phone so I don’t have to think of a word that clearly begins with V.
