![Picture of Me](/images/me.png)

I'm a senior software engineer at Comcast Interactive Media working
on Ruby on Rails and Java projects (all views here are mine and don't reflect
those of Comcast). In previous lives I've done electronic warfare and cyber warfare research plus high peformance computing.

In my spare time I like to play with my new son mess around with electronics,  and reading a lot.
